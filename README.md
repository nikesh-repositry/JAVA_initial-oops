# 🚀 Java Learning Repository

This repository is a complete guide to learning **Java**, starting from environment setup and basic syntax to advanced Object-Oriented Programming principles.  
It serves as a foundation for revision, practice, and solving dsa problems.

## 📂 Repository Structure
I made this repository to have seemless overview of java oops and i done these codes while learning java language here i mainly focused on OOPS

## COVERED TOPICS IN NOTES AND CODES IN THIS REPOSITORY
## 📝 1. Java Fundamentals

### 🔧 The Environment
- **JDK (Java Development Kit):** Tools used for development and execution.  
- **JRE (Java Runtime Environment):** Creates the environment where the code runs.  
- **JVM (Java Virtual Machine):** Responsible for executing the bytecode.  

### 📖 Java Basics
- **PSVM:** Entry point of every Java program (`public static void main`).  
- **Case Sensitivity:** Java is strictly case-sensitive.  
- **Classes:** The basic unit of Java; everything is written inside a class.  
- **Console Output:** Difference between `System.out.print()` and `System.out.println()`.  

### 🔢 Variables & Data Types
- **Primitive Types:** byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, char.  
- **Non-Primitive Types:** String, Array, Object.  
- **Identifiers:** Rules for naming variables (camelCase, no starting numbers, no reserved words).  
- **Final Keyword:** Creating constants that cannot be changed.  

### 🎤 Inputs in Java
- **Scanner Class:** Using `java.util.Scanner` for keyboard input.  
- **Buffer Issues:** Handling leftover newline when switching from `nextInt()` to `nextLine()`.  

### 🔄 Type Casting
- **Widening (Implicit):** int → double.  
- **Narrowing (Explicit):** double → int.
